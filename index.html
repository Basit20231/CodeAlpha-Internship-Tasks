      <h3> 1) QUIZ GAME ON C PROGRAMMING</h3>
      <p>🔹 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐎𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐞𝐰

        The Quiz Game was designed as an engaging tool to test knowledge across various topics, from general knowledge to programming. We developed several features including a scoring system, high score tracking, multiple game levels, and user interaction. The game is structured with three levels: a warm-up round and two progressively challenging rounds.

        In my 2nd semester Spring 2024, my team and I created an Examination System as part of our Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course. As the project leader, it was both challenging and rewarding to work alongside my talented teammates Tara , Vandan Panjwani, Kashish Nihalani, and Vishal Seetlani.
